##  Admonition blocks

You may want to add a sidenote or draw attention to certain statements by taking them out of the content's flow and labeling them with a priority. The syntax is as follows:

```markdown
> #### Tip {: .tip}
>
> This syntax will render an error block
```
- Supported tags: `warning`, `error`, `info`, `tip`, `neutral`
