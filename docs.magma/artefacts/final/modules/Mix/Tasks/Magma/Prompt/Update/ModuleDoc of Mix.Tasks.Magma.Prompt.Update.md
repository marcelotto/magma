# ModuleDoc of Mix.Tasks.Magma.Prompt.Update

## Moduledoc

A Mix task for regenerating artefact prompt documents.

This task is useful for example when an artefact prompt contains the code of a module that has been modified since the creation of the prompt document. By regenerating the artefact prompt, the updated code is reflected in the prompt document.

```sh
$ mix magma.prompt.update "Name of a Prompt"
```

### Command line options

- `--all` - When set, all prompts of the vault are updated.
