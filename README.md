## About the Project

<img src="docs.magma/attachments/screenshot.png" align="center" />

Magma is an environment for writing and executing complex prompts. It is designed primarily to support developers, especially those using Elixir, in collecting project knowledge, generating documentation, and solving problems through LLM prompts. However, it can also be useful outside this context, e.g. for generating longer texts.

_Read on in the [User Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/magma/magma-user-guide-introduction-to-magma-article-section.html)_


## Features

- A transclusion resolution system for quick prompt composition from existing content.
- Extendible workflows with predefined prompts for generating various artefacts such as a project README, module docs, and larger texts.
- Support for automatic prompt execution via the OpenAI API or manual execution via the chat interface of the LLM of your choice (ChatGPT, Bard, Claude etc.).
- Well-organised folder structure for all created files.
- Adaptability to many use cases, thanks to Obsidian's vast plugin ecosystem.
